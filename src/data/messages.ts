Love that little synth that\'s pops up every once and a while, and I could definitely see you vibing out in a colorful ass (almost futuristic) space fashion. Flowing space dress, Glitter, stars, rays of light. All the drug induced visions but coltrolled by a sober mind. I digress. I can def fuck with this haha 😂',
